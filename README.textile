This is a stripped down version of the aec_efficiency
code. The idea is to rip out the part where the
original code was sending UDP packets to the facade
server, add a simple UDP server, and use that to test
drive the aec display driver code

In its current state, this does nothing. The UDP server
that needs to handle display update still needs to be
written.
